## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matthew Romaniuk, I am a third year undergraduate student at Brandon University, taking a BSc with a Computer Sciene major and Business minor.

I am currently working to apply the knowledge I have gained through my schooling into real projects. I plan to create a desktop app that applies methods that exist within the forensic anthropolgy field into an easy-to-use and highly-functional app. I believe this project has real value, as it will teach me the basics of software engineering, as well as creating an app based on "customer" values (the idea of the app came from a friend, who will benefit from the app's existence and support my creation of the app)
